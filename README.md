# Dr. Adkins' Zombie Lab Escape - Michael Elrod

## Motivation
I wanted to go with something basic but also something I dont have experience with which was sprites that had a lot of animations and effects. My inspiration for this is sort of like a game called Vagante which is a 2D dungeon clearing game.

## Reasoning
I went with the stucture that i did becasue I have already built a 2D game engine in C++ so I mostly just transfered over a lot of the logic from that but simpified it since python works a bit differetly
